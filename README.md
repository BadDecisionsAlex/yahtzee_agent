## About

Growing up I played a lot of Yahtzee with my family.  So, I decided that I was
tired of losing and wanted to make an A.I. that maximized the chance of me 
winning!

## Gameplan:
1. TODO: Core game needs a few more features, namely:
	- unsaving dice
	- displaying score card
	
2. Need Agent
	a. Decision Making
		- likely rule based (optimal solution maybe discovered?)
		- neural net (pytorch?)
		- hidden markov model (next states?)
